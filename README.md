# Node App
[Mashreq-Node-App](https://github.com/sudhanshuGitWorld/mashreq-node-app)

# Note
## Due to less time for develop frontend, backend, database & other setup activities:
- There is no input field validation for CRUD
- None of security challenges handled
- You need to connect this app with mongodb


## Feedback
- Respected All, I will appreciate you if I get a feedback from you at developer.sudhanshush@gmail.com.
- I really tried hard in very less time to develop these all features like exact user interface, RESTful api development, backend validation, connect db & frontend to backend.
- I kept it more in more generic way of components and constant.
- If still something is missing, I do regret for that.


# Thankyou !!
